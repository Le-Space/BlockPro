# Module
1. **Blockpro Hardware** (both under one physical seal)
  - BlockPro Prosumer meter
  - BlockPro Light Node (on RaspberryPi)
    - OS and packages
    - Image and installation
2. **BlockPro dApp**
  - BlockPro node & meter onboarding procedure
    - First start scenario and procedure
      1. As BlockPro meter and prosumer node are started first time, the dApp generates a private key which mustn't shown to anybody at anytime
      2. Meter and node must be sealed together after onboarding procedure from the electrician
      3. The dApp's web frontend is available over HTTPS (!) on LAN. official SSL wildcard certificate is needed
      4. In parallel the client, the BlockPro meter & node operator is installing the BlockPro wallet appp on his smartphone or tablet and generates his seed phrase
      5. The resulting public key can be entered to the BlockPro dApp which produces a 1/2 multisig address between client and BlockPro node address. Produced or consumend energy will be stored on that address from the BlockPro node and can be transfered then via the dencentralized exchange to possible consumers.
  - BockPro decentralized wallet (hosted on IPFS)
3. **The KW-Token**
4. **Meter Reading module**
5. **Nano-Ledger App f√ºr Doichain**
6. **Decentralized "KW-Token" Exchange**
6. **Attack Scenarios**
  - 51% Blockchain attack
7. Other blockchain based projects
